        <h3> About this project</h3>
        <p>This project contains a database with 3 tables, using MVC to build all of the views, 
        Linq and Lambda expressions to select and manipulate data. 
        I have created a view model to build one of views and 
        partial views to display the star rating.</p>
        <p>I used dropdown lists for the wine types and body to keep the database input tidy and 
        standard, I refactored the process of re-calculating the over all rate to a method to avoid repeating
         codes in various ActionResults.</p>
        <p>The star rating is a plugin from a vendor, I amended the jquery to suit this project.</p>
        <br />
        <p>This project has brought me to a higher level of understanding and knowledge of C#, ASP.NET MVC,
        bootstrap and brushed on plugin and jquery.</p>
